# SA Rugby Structure

The South African Rugby Structure envisions a future in which the school system develops skilled and talented rugby players on a consistent basis. Given this, the necessity for new clubs and a complete system becomes critical. The goal is to establish a distinctive and functional system that caters exclusively to the South African setting, drawing influence from successful models such as England's rugby system.

The South African Rugby Structure emphasizes the necessity of creating opportunities for players to progress beyond their school careers by anticipating the growth and development of rugby talent in the school system. This includes the formation of new teams and leagues to foster and promote budding talent.

The proposed system's major goal is to ensure that South African rugby thrives by providing a path for bright players to progress from grassroots rugby to the highest levels of competition. We can establish a sustainable and successful rugby landscape by implementing a system that is adapted to our country's requirements and objectives.

## Currie Cup - Prospects

In the proposed South African rugby framework, the Currie Cup will be transformed. It will be played over a two-year cycle and will continue to be a prestigious Rugby Provincial Tournament unique to South Africa. The goal is to design a system that is appropriate for our specific South African context.

The Currie Cup will feature nine teams from South Africa's nine provinces. There is also the option of including a Namibian team to lend an international flavor to the tournament. Alternatively, an extra side comprised of players now playing abroad or Springbok players who are not involved in international fixtures can be formed.

To guarantee a smooth competition, the teams will be split into two groups, with each group playing a single round of group-stage matches. This format allows for a shorter tournament duration while keeping the competition's relevance and intensity.

The tight engagement of the Springboks is one of the most important components of the revamped Currie Cup. National team selectors will be watching the competition attentively in order to uncover talented individuals who might potentially join the Springbok setup. The merger of the Currie Cup and the Springboks will pave the road for aspiring players to reach the elite of South African rugby.

## Premier League Rugby

The projected Rugby Premier League will be South Africa's top-tier league. It will be made up of franchise teams that have met certain criteria in order to participate. The goal of this league is to raise the level of competitiveness and professionalism in South African rugby.

In addition to the Rugby Premier League, a second and third tier league will be established to accommodate emerging clubs and provide opportunity for their growth and development. This multi-tiered structure guarantees that clubs at various levels of growth have access to appropriate platforms for showcasing their skill and progress.

The Rugby Premier League marks the beginning of a new era in South African rugby, with clubs having a clear path to the top and striving for excellence in both on-field performance and off-field standards.
