# Contractual Amendments

2. Performance-Based Salary system: A performance-based salary system will be established, with players earning 40% of their base income. Additional revenues will be based on contract attributes that are determined by contract levels (e.g., A level, B level, C level).

## Contract Attributes include the following:

- Fitness Test: Players' fitness levels will be evaluated on a regular basis, and their success in fitness tests will determine the percentage of their income that they are qualified for. bigger levels of fitness will result in a bigger percentage of compensation earned.

- Goals and Assists: During games, players will earn a percentage of their wage for each goal scored or assist made. For instance, +12% for each goal or assist.

- Saves and Clean Sheets: Goalkeepers will be paid a portion of their income based on the amount of saves and clean sheets they make. For instance, +10% per save.

- Coach Instructions: Players' compliance with coach instructions and strategies will be reviewed, and their performance in this area will factor into their pay eligibility.

- Eligible Contracts for Coaches: Coaches will be placed on comparable eligible contracts, with their remuneration tied to the team's performance and success. This strategy seeks to foster a coherent environment in which players and coaches collaborate to achieve common goals.

- Contract Add-Ons and Maximum wage: By excelling in various performance indicators and achieving contract criteria, players have the ability to earn the maximum wage level and utilize additional incentives provided in their contracts. This encourages players to constantly improve their talents, contribute to the success of the team, and strive for excellence.
