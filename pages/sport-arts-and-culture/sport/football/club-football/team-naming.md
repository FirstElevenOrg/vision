# Team Identification:

In order to maintain a sense of local identity and community pride, the following guidelines for team name in South African football are proposed:

### Club Name Format

Each club will choose a naming format that is appropriate for its geographic location. The city or town will be followed by the district, suburb, or subdivision where the club is based. This strategy highlights the club's relationship to its local community, stressing the distinctive qualities and legacy of each locale. A club in Pinelands, for example, might be known as Pinelands FC, whereas a club in Woodstock would be known as Woodstock United.

### Exclusion of Sponsor Names

In the future, club names should be free of any sponsorship references. This means that sponsor names will not affect or change the club name. By omitting sponsor names from club IDs, the emphasis is exclusively on the geographical area and the community it represents. This will aid in preserving the traditional and original nature of club names while also encouraging a stronger feeling of identity.

South African football hopes to emphasize the importance of local communities and develop a better link between clubs and their various regions by using this team naming technique. This technique will help fans to identify more directly with their local teams, instilling pride and ownership. Furthermore, the elimination of sponsor names will aid in the preservation of club identities, ensuring that they stay consistent and representative of their origins.

## Representation:

<!---Each Province has those big historical clubs name, that must always be visible on the soccer scene of things.-->

The following rules are proposed to ensure fair representation and promote football development across all provinces in South Africa:

### Provincial Representation

At least one team from each province in South Africa should compete in the domestic leagues. This means that each province should have a club, even if it is in the third tier. This strategy intends to create possibilities for talent development and to support football growth in every region of the country. It will serve to highlight the diversity and richness of football in South Africa.

### Relocation and Name Change

If a province does not have a team in the domestic leagues, plans should be made to ask a club from another province with several clubs to relocate and change its home and name in order to represent the province. If all Western Cape clubs are demoted, for example, they can propose that a club such as Soweto FC relocate to Cape Town and become Cape Town FC (Primary City Club). This will ensure that each province has a representative club and the resources it needs to develop.

### League Implementation

The principle of province representation and prospective relocation should be applied at all levels of the league structure, including lower divisions. This ensures that possibilities for talent development and football are distributed fairly across the country. It promotes regional rivalry and engagement, as well as the recognition of local talent.

South African football hopes to build a more inclusive and representative organization by applying these standards, allowing every province to be a part of the football scene. It promotes the growth and promotion of football at all levels by providing equal opportunities for players, coaches, and communities across the country.
