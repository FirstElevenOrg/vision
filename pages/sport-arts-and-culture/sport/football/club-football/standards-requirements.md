# Suburban and Club Representation Standards and Requirements

Specific qualifications and regulations must be met in order for a suburb, sub-division, city, or town to have league representation. This requirement applies not only to suburbs, but also to all other municipal divisions. The criteria will be based on a variety of elements, such as the availability of playing fields, the presence of suitable infrastructure, and the overall potential to maintain a healthy football league.

One important condition is the availability of a stadium with a large seating capacity, often set at 50,000 or more spectators. This stadium will be the primary site for games, attracting supporters and generating a lively environment. The presence of such a stadium demonstrates the community's aspiration and potential to stage high-level professional football matches.

These standards will also apply to the clubs in each division. Even after being promoted to a higher tier, a club must still meet top-tier standards and regulations. This entails owning or having access to a sufficient stadium that matches the capacity and infrastructural requirements. Owning a stadium guarantees the club a stable home ground and the ability to provide a superb match-day experience for both players and supporters.

The league intends to ensure that each division, club, and community is properly ready to participate and grow in the footballing ecosystem by establishing these high criteria and requirements. It promotes a culture of professionalism, infrastructural development, and sustainability, allowing the game to thrive at all levels and improving South Africa's entire football scene.
