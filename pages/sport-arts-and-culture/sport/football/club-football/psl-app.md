This software will act as a consolidated platform for South African football at all levels, giving updates and facilitating numerous features. The following are the primary features of the PSL app:

#### Portals

The app will feature many portals for successfully capturing and managing data. These websites will ensure that all stakeholders involved in South African football can communicate and share information in real time.

Within the app, clubs will have their own dedicated portal where they can log issues, send reports, and contact with league management. This site provides a communication tool for clubs to address issues and provide updates.

#### League Portal

League administrators will have access to a portal where they may make adjustments, update fixtures, and report game results. This site ensures effective league administration and management.

#### Manager Portal

Managers will get access to a specialized portal that will allow them to browse player profiles from all divisions. Managers can use this function to scout talent at various levels and invite lower-league players to their camps for trials or prospective recruitment.

#### Scout Portal

Scouts will have their own portal within the program that will allow them to track and evaluate players from all divisions. This site aids in the identification of talent and the scouting of players.

#### Officials site

Referees and linesmen will have access to a site where they will be able to check match assignments, submit match reports, and communicate with league management. This portal helps authorities and the league communicate more effectively.

#### Scorer Portal

The app will contain a scorer portal, which will allow designated users to score games directly through the app. This function enables real-time game scoring and assures correct match statistics recording.

#### Game Updates and Results

The PSL app will deliver detailed updates on all divisions of South African football matches, results, and league standings. Users can view the most recent scores, match data, and standings within their divisions.

The PSL app intends to centralize information, streamline communication, and create a user-friendly platform for all South African football stakeholders. The app improves efficiency, transparency, and accessibility by harnessing technology, ultimately contributing to the overall development and prosperity of football in South Africa.
