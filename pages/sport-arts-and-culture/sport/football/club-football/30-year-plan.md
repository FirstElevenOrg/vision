# International Football Scholarships for Young Players

We propose introducing an international scholarship program for talented young footballers aged 8 to 14 in our 30-year plan for South African football. The selection method for these scholarships will entail attentively monitoring their performance in competitions and assessing their potential from an early age.

Selection Criteria: The selection process will be centered on discovering talented and passionate young players who have extraordinary abilities, commitment, and potential.

- The under 7's events will be used to scout and identify these bright players.

  - Scholarships: We aim to award scholarships to 100 young footballers who match the selection requirements each year. This will provide a steady flow of talented players into the program and allow for a big impact on South African football development.

  - International Placement: - The selected young footballers will be sent to known footballing countries such as England, Spain, Brazil, and others to develop their talents.

- They will be enrolled in elite clubs' young development programs, where they will receive the required training, exposure, and competition to further develop their skills.

  - Sponsorship Requirements: - The sponsorship program will be tailored for serious and committed individuals who have demonstrated success potential.

- Contracts and agreements with sponsors will be drafted, specifying specific criteria and expectations for sponsored players.
- Sponsorship contracts may include legally enforceable terms such as a limited number of tries to gain a professional contract through successful trials within a certain timeframe.
- Additionally, contracts may include stipulations prohibiting the use of alcohol throughout the contract time as well as fitness goals to ensure that players maintain a disciplined and concentrated approach.

By establishing this worldwide scholarship program, we hope to give excellent chances for growth and development for talented South African footballers in top footballing countries. This will allow players to strengthen their skills, acquire exposure to higher levels of competition, and contribute to South African football's general improvement.
