# PSL Restructuring

We propose implementing a reorganization plan that prioritizes quality over quantity to raise the Premier Soccer League's (PSL) ranking and position it as a top league in the globe. The goal is to make the environment for players more focused and competitive, while also encouraging skill development and building a stronger football culture.

- Limiting the Number of Teams: We feel that limiting the number of teams in the PSL will boost players' seriousness and professionalism.
- This will allow athletes to concentrate more on their football careers and develop a greater degree of technical ability.
- Quality players who are sincerely passionate and dedicated to football should be prioritized above a big number of players who may not be as committed.

  ### Structure 1

  - Premier Soccer League (PSL) - 12 teams at Level 1
  - PSL League 1 - 10 clubs at Level 2
  - PSL League 2 - 10 teams at Level 3
  - PSL Central Soccer League (Level 4) - 20 clubs

  ### Structure 2

  - Premier Soccer League (PSL) - 12 teams at Level 1
  - PSL League 1 - 16 clubs at Level 2
  - PSL League 2 - 20 teams at Level 3
  - PSL Central Soccer League (Level 4) - 24 clubs

  ### Structure 3

  - Premier Soccer League (PSL) - 12 teams at Level 1
  - PSL Championship - 20 teams at Level 2
  - PSL Central Soccer League - 24 clubs at Level 3

  ### Structure 4

  - Premier Soccer League (PSL) - 12 teams at Level 1
  - PSL Championship - 10 teams at Level 2
  - PSL League 1 - 10 teams at Level 3
  - PSL League 2 - 10 teams at Level 4
  - PSL Central Soccer League - 20 clubs at Level 5

These new frameworks are intended to give South African football with a more streamlined and competitive environment. Each structure provides a unique team configuration across various tiers, allowing for greater attention, increased competition, and higher play quality. The specific structure chosen will be determined by the goals and objectives of the South African governing body as well as the parties involved.

## Potential Further Reduction

- If the intended improvements are not achieved, the option of further reducing the number of teams in the top tier remains.

- One probable scenario would be to reduce the top tier to only six teams, with each team having two squads of 25 men. The players who remain can be farmed out to lower-tier clubs to earn playing time and experience.

We hope to achieve a more competitive and focused environment within the PSL by following this restructuring strategy. This will raise the level of competition, encourage skill development, and bring more attention and prominence to the South African football landscape. The emphasis on quality over quantity will contribute to the PSL's overall progress and reputation as a world-class league.

This extensive league structure strives to create a well-organized and competitive football ecosystem in South Africa. Each category represents a distinct region, ensuring that teams from various provinces and towns have extensive representation and opportunity. The framework encourages football growth, competitiveness, and grassroots participation, allowing players and teams to advance through the ranks and demonstrate their abilities at various levels.

## Club Names

The new league system emphasizes that clubs should be called after sub-divisions, suburbs, cities, or towns, rather than persons, hence eliminating the tradition of naming clubs after individuals. The goal is to foster a deeper feeling of community ownership in which groups authentically represent the community to which they belong. Sponsorships will no longer have the right to rename clubs as part of this method, ensuring that club names remain anchored in their respective communities and retain their historical relevance. This move attempts to promote a stronger sense of identification and pride among the clubs and the communities they represent.

### Example

- Khayelitsha United
- Khayelitsha FC
- Stand FC
- Parow FC
- Karoo United
- Cape Town City
- Paarl FC
